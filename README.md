### People Against Generally Shitty Things Discrod Bot

## Installation
You have to know how to fill the environment file and setup the bot via Discord - intents need to be enabled!

the rest is:

Bot install tutorial > [LBRY for Arch](https://lbry.tv/@caubert:c47/pagst-yagpdb-install-on-archlinux:4)
or > [LBRY for FreeBSD](https://lbry.tv/@caubert:c47/pagstbsd-self-hosting-yagpdb-on-freebsd:b)

Installation really depends on how you like to deploy code.
This branch is not meant for docker or some other huge scalability method.

## Various
What's there to say.
caubert forked it and changed the license type.
Real code is in Jonas747's git > [GitHub](https://github.com/jonas747/yagpdb) - I still call it master.

Go away now : )
